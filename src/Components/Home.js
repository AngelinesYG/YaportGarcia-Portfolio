            <h4>I am a busy and loving mom with a BA in Creative Writing and a Minor in Psychology from Rowan University. My passion for design and creativity led me to pursue more innovative and challenging ways to create, inspiring a career pivot to become a certified Software Engineer. Right after graduating, I became a contributor in two startups as a means to continue practicing and improving my skills. When I am not volunteering, I am researching the different technologies, or networking to meet likeminded individuals.</h4>
